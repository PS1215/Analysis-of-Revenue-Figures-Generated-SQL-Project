"Cracking the Code: E-Commerce Revenue Unleashed ðŸš€"

This SQL-powered project dives deep into the revenue streams of modern e-commerceâ€”marketplaces (Amazon, Flipkart), DTC brands, and mobile-first shopping. Using advanced data visualization and analytics, it uncovers game-changing trends, performance drivers, and consumer behaviors shaping the digital marketplace.

Key takeaways? Marketplaces dominate in volume, but DTC channels win on brand loyalty. Social commerce is exploding among Gen Z, and mobile-driven strategiesâ€”think AI-powered dynamic pricing and hyper-personalized adsâ€”are redefining online shopping.

The result? Actionable insights that empower businesses to optimize sales, leverage tech innovations, and stay ahead in the fast-evolving e-commerce battleground. ðŸ’¡ðŸ”¥
